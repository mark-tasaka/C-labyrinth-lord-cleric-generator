# C-labyrinth-lord-cleric-generator
Coding in the C language, the Labyrinth Lord Cleric Character Generator allows for the random generation of a level 1 Cleric character. A dice rolling mechanic is created for rolling 3 six-sided dice for the Cleric ability scores, as well as an 'if statement' is in place to ensure the Cleric has minimum dexterity and constitution scores of 9. Random function has also been created to represent the dice rolling mechanics for the hit points and the starting gold. Weapons, armour and equipment options are available for the Cleric. Once the character has been created, and items purchased for the character, the user has the option of saving the file was an external txt file.
